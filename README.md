Phase (and tempo) Inference from Point Process Event Timing - python3 implementation. 

See Jonathan Cannon's reference implementation in MATLAB: https://github.com/joncannon/PIPPET

Notes:
- **Warning:** this has _not_ been thoroughly tested, use at your own risk!
- Currently only a single event stream is supported. It should be trivial to extend this to multiple event streams.

Please feel free to raise a pull request, additional utilities would be much appreciated.
